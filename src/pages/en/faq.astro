      },
      {
        question: "Do I need a ticket to join DevFest Bari?",
        answer:
          "Yes, participation to the DevFest is free, but registration is mandatory. Being in the waiting list is not sufficient to participate to the conference.",
      },
      {
        question: "I can't attend the DevFest, what should I do?",
        answer:
          "If you can't attend we kindly ask you to cancel your order via the GDG platform, or either send us an email (we can do it for you).",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to print my tickets?",
        answer:
          "No, you can use your smartphone to show us the ticket. Showing the ticket email with the QR code is also enough. Please make sure to have your ticket ready to do not slow down the check-in process.",
      },
      {
        question: "Should I come even if I'm still on the waiting list?",
        answer:
          "You can come even if you're in the waiting list, but we can't assure you will get a spot. We will release tickets of people that don't show up during day so you may have a chance to get in, but this is out of our control, and we can't tell you in advance if you'll get a place.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I give my ticket to a friend?",
        answer:
          "Sadly this is not possible. If you're not planning to come, please cancel your ticket and ask your friend to register themselves for a new ticket.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I leave the conference and come back later?",
        answer:
          "Yes, you can always leave the conference and come back whenever you want. To enter the venue you anyway always need your badge (you will get it at the entrance).",
      },
      {
        question: "What should I carry on to the conference?",
        answer:
          "Your ticket. That's the only necessary thing you shouldn't forget.",

      {
        question: "I am a student and I want to participate. How can I do it?",

          "If you are a student, talk to your teachers and have them contact us. If you want to participate independently, contact us and we will help you.",
      },
      {
        question: "What should I do if I have problems with the tickets?",
        answer:
          "If you have any problems with the tickets, do not hesitate to contact us privately.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are the tickets limited in availability?",
        answer:
          "Yes, tickets are limited in number, so we recommend that the entire class registers simultaneously to avoid anyone being left without a ticket.",
      },
      {
        question: "Which email should I use to register?",
        answer:
          "It is important to register for the school ticket using your institutional email.",

        question: "What should I do if I can no longer participate?",
        answer:
          "If you can no longer participate, we ask you to cancel your event registration so that someone else can attend!",
      },
      {
        question: "I am a teacher, do I need to register as well?",
        answer:
          "Yes, if you are a teacher you still need to register like your students, using your institutional email.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "I am a high school student, my class is registered to attend the DevFest, do I need to get a ticket?",
        answer: "Yes, remember to get the school ticket.",
      },
      {
        question: "I am a teacher, how can I register the class?",
        answer:
          "To register the class, you need to fill out the schools@devfest bari 2024 form. The form is an expression of interest that allows us to have a better view of the classes that want to participate. However, it is necessary that each student individually gets a ticket to participate. Seats are limited, so we recommend doing it as soon as possible.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "I am a high school student, my class is not registered to attend the DevFest but I still want to participate independently, how can I participate?",
        answer:
          "Sure! If you are coming independently, you can still participate in the DevFest! Remember to get the regular ticket in this case.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "I have the school ticket, is it mandatory to follow the track of talks dedicated to students?",
        answer:
          "Following the track of talks dedicated to students is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended.",
      },
      {
        question: "What does the school ticket include?",
        answer:
          "The school ticket allows access to the entire event area and participation in all tracks and workshops. It also grants priority access to the student track, specifically designed for high school students/recent graduates. The track will last half a morning as it is designed to cover school hours. For the same reason, the school ticket does not include the lunch box.",
